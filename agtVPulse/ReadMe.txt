This software is an Add-in accessory for the 
Agilent IntuiLink Waveform Editor for the
33120A/33250A. The Add-in will create Pulse
Waveforms using the arbitrary waveform
with variable rise/fall times. The  shapes
for the rise/fall times can be Linear,
Exponential, Half-Cosine, or Gaussian. The
Add-in will be found in the 'Tools' menu.
Intended for use with slow (>100 nsec) rise/fall times.

This install will install the Add-in (agtVPulse.dll) 
to the default directory:
'Program Files/Agilent/IntuiLink/Waveform Generator/Tools'
If the Waveform Editor is installed in another directory
change the default of this install, or copy the file
agtVPulse.dll to the ..\Waveform Generator\Tools directory.

You must have version 1.2 of the Waveform Editor or
later. If you have an earlier version, uninstall 
the earlier version and then install the later version.
